# Bikcraft
A handcrafted custom bicycle company website.

## The Project
Bikcraft was design and developed during the course *Complete Web Design* at the [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/) platform. It is a clone from the original design by [Andr√© Rafael](https://github.com/origamid).

The goal of the project was to learn the principles of **UX/UI design** and to translate the layout into real code using modern **HTML** and **CSS** syntaxes. I recreated the design from the Wireframe, using all the planning phase research with the goal to make a good and intuitive experience for the users.

**Optimization of images and other files**, **SEO** were also part of the content and put in pratice during the implementation.

## Coming Soon
- **SASS** will be implemented soon, along with more modern layout **CSS** options.

## Languages and technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript (basic)
- PHP (using [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer))
  
## Demo
- You can access Bikcraft clicking [here](https://bikcraft.daniaversa.dev).
- Alternatively you can clone the repository and run it locally following these steps:
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danielaversa/bikcraft

# Open the bikcraft directory
cd bikcraft
```
You will need then to create a local live server with a software like XAMPP or Live Server and access the **index.html** file.
