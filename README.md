## The Project
Bikcraft was design and developed during the course *Complete Web Design* at the [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/) platform. It is a clone from the original design by [Andr√© Rafael](https://github.com/origamid).

The goal of the project was to learn the principles of **UX/UI design** and to translate the layout into real code using modern **HTML** and **CSS** syntaxes. I recreated the design from the Wireframe, using all the planning phase research with the goal to make a good and intuitive experience for the users.

**Optimization of images and other files**, **SEO** were also part of the content and put in pratice during the implementation.

## Coming Soon
- **SASS** will be implemented soon, along with more modern layout **CSS** options.

## Languages and technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript (basic)
- PHP (using [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer))
